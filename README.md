#### **__Past Experience:__**
1. I consulted for a Children's Charity, analysing qualitative and quantitative data to ensure the most efficacious use of the Charity's funding.
   
2. While working in education, I analysed a core department's provision before leading and implementing changes that resulted in the department performing in the top 1% of the UK at GCSE 

3. I have successfully line managed UQTs, experienced teachers, multiple departments across Key Stage 3 and 4, year teams and the provision of new teacher training in the borough of Hounslow

4. In 2020 I achieved a Distinction in my MA by achieving a Distinction in all my essays, including my disseratation
   
#### **__Where I want to go next:__**
The solutions to problems do not lie in doing what's been done previously and hoping for a better result. 

Through applying Data Science principles I hope to be part of projects that create new insights into old problems and find practical solutions.
